The all code is write in clang.And the dictionary is store in Redis.

Redis dictionary format is as below:

set 户 '{"0":"户外","1":"户型"}'

set 背 '{"0":"背包","1":"背景"}'

as you see,The first chinese word is the key of Redis.

And the most process logic is in the "main.c".

This is a picture of my pariticiple project.
